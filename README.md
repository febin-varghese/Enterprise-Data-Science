# Enterprise-Data-Science
This repository includes an introductory data science project. This project is done as a part of my master program.
COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 2019) data is collected from the [John Hopkins repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
The data is processed and filtered. An interactive dashboard is created to visualize the data and 
the dashboard is developed using [Plotly-Dash](https://plotly.com/). 
Object oriented programming approach is employed in this project. 
Two different dashboards are created for better realization.

Run "main_program.py" to visualize the data.
